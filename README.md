# Syntax - Challenge

## Overview
This is a basic challenge to practice the java syntax. 

## Project Description

- **Project Name:** BankAccount
- **Objective:** To receive data via terminal containing bank account characteristics.

### Tasks

1. **Create the Project:**
   - Project should be named `BankAccount`.
   - It will receive data via terminal based on the following attributes.

2. **Create a Class:**
   - Name the class `AccountTerminal.java`.
   - This class will handle all the coding for our program.

3. **Variables Declaration:**
   - Review the rules for declaring variables.
   - Attributes and their types are as follows:

     | Attribute    | Type    | Example   |
     |--------------|---------|-----------|
     | Number       | Integer | 1021      |
     | Agency       | Text    | 067-8     |
     | Client Name  | Text    | James Tartt |
     | Balance      | Decimal | 237.48    |

4. **Using the Terminal:**
   - Review about terminal, `main args`, and the `Scanner` class.
   - Implement data entry via terminal.

5. **User Input:**
   - Users will receive prompts for each information.
   - Example:
     ```
     Program: "Please, enter the Agency number!"
     User: 1021 (then ENTER for the next field)
     ```

6. **String Concatenation:**
   - Review about concatenation and the `String` class with the `concat` method.

7. **Final Output:**
   - After data entry, display the message:
     ```
     "Hello [Client Name], thank you for creating an account in our bank, your agency is [Agency], account [Number], and your balance [Balance] is already available for withdrawal."
     ```
   - Replace the fields in `[ ]` with the user-entered information.
